I've taken the FAQ info from the [toptal.com](https://www.toptal.com/faq#toptal-different) website and made a class that can process similar questions and give answers based on the info from the page. The foundation here is **TF-IDF** and distances between vectorized sentences. 

**Stack**: `Sklearn`, `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Requests`, `BeautifulSoup`
